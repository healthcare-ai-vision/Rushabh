This repository contains my week-wise work for the AI for Healthcare (WiDS’25) program, where I explored how medical images can be processed and analyzed using deep learning. 

In Week 1, I studied the science behind images and medical imaging reports to understand how visual data is converted into clinical information. 

In Week 2, I implemented core image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, histogram analysis, resizing, edge detection, and noise filtering, and explored two healthcare datasets—COVID-19 chest X-ray images and the HAM10000 skin lesion dataset—analyzing their class distributions, imbalance, and challenges like visual similarity and limited data. 

In Week 3, I analyzed a skin cancer dataset containing Melanoma and Basal Cell Carcinoma images and trained a CNN-based classification model using YOLO (Ultralytics), studying dataset splits, augmentations, and model performance. I am currently continuing this project and actively working on the upcoming weekly tasks to further extend the healthcare AI pipeline.

Week 4 focuses on implementing an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for automated detection and quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in histopathology images. The work is aligned with the TIGER Grand Challenge and addresses a real-world clinical problem in digital pathology. During this week, a labeled histopathology dataset was downloaded and analyzed, ground-truth annotations were visualized, and a YOLOv8-based object detection model was trained using transfer learning. The model was evaluated using standard detection metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision, and its predictions were visualized through bounding box overlays. Post-processing techniques were applied to convert detected lymphocyte counts into TIL density and clinically interpretable scores. Additionally, activation-based heatmaps were generated to provide explainability and insight into model decision-making. This week’s work demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to clinically relevant medical imaging tasks while emphasizing reproducibility, interpretability, and quantitative evaluation.
