This repository contains my week-wise work for the AI for Healthcare (WiDS’25) program, where I explored how medical images can be processed and analyzed using deep learning. 

In Week 1, I studied the science behind images and medical imaging reports to understand how visual data is converted into clinical information. 

In Week 2, I implemented core image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, histogram analysis, resizing, edge detection, and noise filtering, and explored two healthcare datasets—COVID-19 chest X-ray images and the HAM10000 skin lesion dataset—analyzing their class distributions, imbalance, and challenges like visual similarity and limited data. 

In Week 3, I analyzed a skin cancer dataset containing Melanoma and Basal Cell Carcinoma images and trained a CNN-based classification model using YOLO (Ultralytics), studying dataset splits, augmentations, and model performance. I am currently continuing this project and actively working on the upcoming weekly tasks to further extend the healthcare AI pipeline.
